Theme built with webstores in mind. The test enviroment is a clothing and apparel store.

## Initial goals
Get a better understanding of customizing a woocommerce store and setup Klarna checkout and similar.
Make a responsive web and accessible store that functions as intended for all users.

## Future goals
Publish theme on either wp.org as a free theme, or as a premium theme on a theme selling platform (or maybe even on my own site?).
Rebuild the front-end with REST API and either Vue or React.
